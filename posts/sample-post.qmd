## **Abstract**

In forward curve trading, a classic carry strategy involves going long on the spot market while simultaneously shorting a future contract, thereby capturing the implied rate of return as the forward converges to the spot at maturity. This implied return reflects the embedded interest rate in the term structure of the forward curve.

However, mark-to-market dynamics introduce a key source of path dependency. When general price levels rise, the short futures leg becomes loss-making, potentially triggering margin calls. Traders must then inject capital or unwind part of the position, leading to a realized return that diverges from the originally implied yield.

Conversely, if price levels fall, margin balances become cashflow-positive, enabling position scaling and potentially increasing the strategy's effective return. This asymmetric cashflow exposure makes the anticipated portfolio return sensitive to shifts in the absolute level of the forward curve — i.e., it becomes long-biased in curve level.

To mitigate this exposure and reduce volatility in realized returns, a modified strategy involves holding an additional long position further along the curve. This acts as a natural hedge against upward shifts in the forward curve, smoothing P&L fluctuations and aligning realized performance more closely with the initial implied rate. The result is a more robust, convex strategy that stabilizes capital efficiency while preserving the core carry logic.

## **The Mechanics of the Calendar Spread**

A **calendar spread** — also known as a time spread — involves taking offsetting positions in the same underlying asset across two different maturities. In commodities markets, this typically means going:

- **Long the front (near-term) contract**
- **Short the deferred (longer-term) contract**

or vice versa, depending on the shape of the forward curve and expectations about how it will evolve. In a classic **carry strategy**, the trader seeks to capture the **implied yield** embedded in a contango curve, where future prices are above near-term prices. The basic position structure is:

- **Long the front-month contract (or spot)**
- **Short a later-dated future**

This setup profits as the forward converges toward the spot price over time.

### **Implied Carry Return**

The theoretical return from this strategy derives from the forward curve slope. Let:

- $F_0$: price of the deferred future  
- $S_0$: spot or near-term future price  
- $T$: time to maturity (in years)  

Then the annualized implied return is:


$$
r_{\text{annual}} = \left( \frac{F_0}{S_0} \right)^{\frac{365}{T}} - 1
$$

This compounded return reflects what the trader would earn if the carry strategy were repeated continuously throughout the year, assuming no path dependency or capital withdrawal effects. This return also assumes the position is held to maturity and that no capital is forcibly withdrawn due to interim losses (e.g., margin calls).

### **Execution Mechanics**

In practice, calendar spreads are executed using exchange-traded futures. Each leg is margined separately, and marked-to-market (MTM) **daily**. Then the **compounded annualized return on capital deployed** is:

$$
r_{\text{capital}} = \left( \frac{F + m}{S_0 + m} \right)^{\frac{365}{T}} - 1
$$

This return reflects how margin directly affects capital efficiency. As $m$ increases, the denominator grows, and the return on capital shrinks — even if price differentials remain constant.


- **Losses** on one leg require margin top-ups  
- **Gains** on the other leg increase available collateral  

This introduces **path dependency**: if prices move sharply in one direction, the losing leg may require cash injections **before** the position converges profitably. This dynamic can cause a divergence between **theoretical and realized** returns, especially in volatile or one-sided markets.



---


Because both legs of a futures spread are marked-to-market (MTM) daily, interim price movements impact capital allocation — even if the spread itself is profitable by expiration. Suppose the strategy is normalized to **1 contract per leg**, with:

- $S_0$: initial spot or near-future price  
- $F_0$: deferred future price  
- $m = \frac{S_0}{M}$: margin required per contract (assumed a constant fraction of spot is required by the brokers)  
- Initial capital: $S_0 + m$

---

### **Capital-Constrained Position Adjustment**

We now derive how the number of contracts adjusts after any price movement, based purely on capital accounting.

Let:

- $S_0$: initial spot price  
- $F_0$: initial futures price  
- $S_1$: current spot price  
- $F_1$: current futures price  
- $m = \dfrac{S_0}{M}$: margin required per contract  
- $C = S_0 + m$: total capital initially allocated to the strategy  

---

#### **Updated Capital After Mark-to-Market**

The mark-to-market (MTM) value change on the futures leg is:

$$
\Delta F = F_1 - F_0
$$

This is **positive** if the futures price increased (a loss on the short), and **negative** if the futures price decreased (a gain on the short).

The updated available capital becomes:

$$
C_{\text{after}} = S_1 + m - \Delta F = S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)
$$

---

#### **New Number of Contracts**

Each unit of the strategy now costs:

$$
S_1 + m
$$

Let $\alpha$ be the number of contracts that the updated capital can support:

$$
\alpha = \frac{C_{\text{after}}}{S_1 + m} = \frac{S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)}{S_1 + m}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{
\alpha = 1 - \frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}
}
$$

---

#### **Interpretation**

- The expression $1 - \alpha$ gives the **fractional change in position size**.
- If $F_1 > F_0$, then $\alpha < 1$ → **some contracts must be liquidated**
- If $F_1 < F_0$, then $\alpha > 1$ → **position can be scaled up**
- The sign of $(1 - \alpha)$ is directly determined by the direction of futures price movement.

This shows how mark-to-market effects induce **forced deleveraging** or **capital-free leveraging**, depending on the change in futures price, even if the underlying spread logic remains intact.


### **Adjusted Return on Capital**

After resizing the position to $\alpha$ contracts, the final payoff at maturity becomes:

$$
\text{Payoff}_{\text{final}} = \alpha \cdot (F_0 + m)
$$

The original capital deployed was:

$$
C = S_0 + m
$$

Therefore, the **adjusted return** is:

$$
\boxed{
r_{\text{adjusted}} = \frac{\alpha \cdot (F_0 + m)}{S_0 + m} - 1
}
$$

Substituting the expression for $\alpha$:

$$
\alpha = 1 - \frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}
$$

We get:

$$
r_{\text{adjusted}} = \left(1 - \frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m} \right) \cdot \frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1
$$

This expression quantifies how **mark-to-market price movement** impacts the final return — even though the initial strategy logic (buy low, sell high) is unchanged.

- If $F_1 > F_0$ → position is **deleveraged** → return is **diluted**
- If $F_1 < F_0$ → position is **leveraged up** → return is **amplified**

This is a concrete expression of how **capital constraints** under daily margining introduce **convexity** into realized returns.


## Return Dynamics Under Uniform Price Shock

We explore how uniform shocks to spot and futures prices affect the realized return on capital when margin requirements force dynamic position sizing.

Let the initial capital be:

$$
C = S_0 + m \quad \text{with} \quad m = M \cdot S_0
$$

Under a return shock \( r \), we assume:

$$
S_1 = S_0 (1 + r), \quad F_1 = F_0 (1 + r)
$$

Then, the **adjusted return on capital** is:

$$
r_{\text{adjusted}} = \left(1 - \frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\right) \cdot \frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1
$$

The baseline return when \( r = 0 \) is:

$$
r_{\text{baseline}} = \frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1
$$




```{python}
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
S0 = 100
F0 = 105
M = 0.1
m = M * S0

# Shock range
r_vals = np.linspace(-0.3, 0.3, 200)  # -30% to +30%

# Post-shock values
S1 = S0 * (1 + r_vals)
F1 = F0 * (1 + r_vals)

# Adjusted return computation
alpha = 1 - (F1 - F0) / (S1 + m)
r_adjusted = (alpha * (F0 + m) / (S0 + m)) - 1

# Baseline return
r_baseline = (F0 + m) / (S0 + m) - 1

## **Managing Margin-Induced Convexity: Hedging with Spot**

On paper, the classic calendar spread strategy appears risk-free — the profit is “locked in” via the forward curve. However, in practice, **daily margining introduces path dependency**. If the general price level rises, the **short futures leg loses value**, triggering margin calls and forcing **liquidation** of part of the long position.

This causes the strategy to behave like it's **short in the price level $r$**: upward moves reduce return. The realized P&L becomes **concave** even when the theoretical spread remains unchanged.

---

### **Risk Management via Spot Allocation**

To manage this convexity, one simple hedge is to **hold a small spot position** alongside the calendar spread.

Let:

- $C = S_0 + m$: total capital  
- $\beta \in [0, 1]$: fraction of capital allocated to spot  
- $(1 - \beta) \cdot C$: capital deployed in the calendar spread  
- $\beta \cdot C$: capital held in spot

---

### **Returns on Each Leg**

- The calendar spread grows at rate $r_{\text{adjusted}}$  
- The spot grows at rate $r$

Then the total final value is:

$$
V_{\text{final}} = (1 - \beta)C(1 + r_{\text{adjusted}}) + \beta C(1 + r)
$$

Divide by initial capital $C$ to get the total portfolio return:

$$
\boxed{
r_{\text{hedged}} = (1 - \beta)(1 + r_{\text{adjusted}}) + \beta(1 + r) - 1
}
$$

This shows that the **hedged return** is a convex combination of the risky strategy and the linear spot move. It **smooths drawdowns** when the market moves against the short leg, reducing the impact of margin-induced deleveraging.



## **Visualizing the Impact of Spot Hedging on Return Convexity**

The plot below compares two versions of the adjusted return:

- **Unhedged return** ($\beta = 0$): exposed to margin-induced deleveraging
- **Hedged return** ($\beta = 50\%$): partially protected by holding spot

This shows how allocating part of capital to spot can **reduce concavity** in realized returns by mitigating forced position adjustments during price rises.
