This implied return reflects the embedded interest rate in the term structure of the forward curve.\n\nHowever, mark-to-market dynamics introduce a key source of path dependency. When general price levels rise, the short futures leg becomes loss-making, potentially triggering margin calls. Traders must then inject capital or unwind part of the position, leading to a realized return that diverges from the originally implied yield.\n\nConversely, if price levels fall, margin balances become cashflow-positive, enabling position scaling and potentially increasing the strategy's effective return. This asymmetric cashflow exposure makes the anticipated portfolio return sensitive to shifts in the absolute level of the forward curve — i.e., it becomes long-biased in curve level.\n\nTo mitigate this exposure and reduce volatility in realized returns, a modified strategy involves holding an additional long position further along the curve. This acts as a natural hedge against upward shifts in the forward curve, smoothing P&L fluctuations and aligning realized performance more closely with the initial implied rate. The result is a more robust, convex strategy that stabilizes capital efficiency while preserving the core carry logic.\n\n---\n\n## **The Mechanics of the Calendar Spread**\n\nA **calendar spread** — also known as a time spread — involves taking offsetting positions in the same underlying asset across two different maturities. In commodities markets, this typically means going:\n\n- **Long the front (near-term) contract**\n- **Short the deferred (longer-term) contract**\n\nor vice versa, depending on the shape of the forward curve and expectations about how it will evolve. In a classic **carry strategy**, the trader seeks to capture the **implied yield** embedded in a contango curve, where future prices are above near-term prices. The basic position structure is:\n\n- **Long the front-month contract (or spot)**\n- **Short a later-dated future**\n\nThis setup profits as the forward converges toward the spot price over time.\n\n### **Implied Carry Return**\n\nThe theoretical return from this strategy derives from the forward curve slope. Let:\n\n- $F_0$: price of the deferred future  \n- $S_0$: spot or near-term future price  \n- $T$: time to maturity (in years)  \n\nThen the annualized implied return is:\n\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{annual}} = \\left( \\frac{F_0}{S_0} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n$$\n\nThis compounded return reflects what the trader would earn if the carry strategy were repeated continuously throughout the year, assuming no path dependency or capital withdrawal effects. This return also assumes the position is held to maturity and that no capital is forcibly withdrawn due to interim losses (e.g., margin calls).\n\n### **Execution Mechanics**\n\nIn practice, calendar spreads are executed using exchange-traded futures. Each leg is margined separately, and marked-to-market (MTM) **daily**. Then the **compounded annualized return on capital deployed** is:\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{capital}} = \\left( \\frac{F + m}{S_0 + m} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n$$\n\nThis return reflects how margin directly affects capital efficiency. As $m$ increases, the denominator grows, and the return on capital shrinks — even if price differentials remain constant.\n\n\n- **Losses** on one leg require margin top-ups  \n- **Gains** on the other leg increase available collateral  \n\nThis introduces **path dependency**: if prices move sharply in one direction, the losing leg may require cash injections **before** the position converges profitably. This dynamic can cause a divergence between **theoretical and realized** returns, especially in volatile or one-sided markets.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nBecause both legs of a futures spread are marked-to-market (MTM) daily, interim price movements impact capital allocation — even if the spread itself is profitable by expiration. Suppose the strategy is normalized to **1 contract per leg**, with:\n\n- $S_0$: initial spot or near-future price  \n- $F_0$: deferred future price  \n- $m = \\frac{S_0}{M}$: margin required per contract (assumed a constant fraction of spot is required by the brokers)  \n- Initial capital: $S_0 + m$\n\n---\n\n### **Capital-Constrained Position Adjustment**\n\nWe now derive how the number of contracts adjusts after any price movement, based purely on capital accounting.\n\nLet:\n\n- $S_0$: initial spot price  \n- $F_0$: initial futures price  \n- $S_1$: current spot price  \n- $F_1$: current futures price  \n- $m = \\dfrac{S_0}{M}$: margin required per contract  \n- $C = S_0 + m$: total capital initially allocated to the strategy  \n\n---\n\n#### **Updated Capital After Mark-to-Market**\n\nThe mark-to-market (MTM) value change on the futures leg is:\n\n$$\n\\Delta F = F_1 - F_0\n$$\n\nThis is **positive** if the futures price increased (a loss on the short), and **negative** if the futures price decreased (a gain on the short).\n\nThe updated available capital becomes:\n\n$$\nC_{\\text{after}} = S_1 + m - \\Delta F = S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### **New Number of Contracts**\n\nEach unit of the strategy now costs:\n\n$$\nS_1 + m\n$$\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be the number of contracts that the updated capital can support:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{C_{\\text{after}}}{S_1 + m} = \\frac{S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)}{S_1 + m}\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\n}\n$$\n\n---\n\n#### **Interpretation**\n\n- The expression $1 - \\alpha$ gives the **fractional change in position size**.\n- If $F_1 > F_0$, then $\\alpha < 1$ → **some contracts must be liquidated**\n- If $F_1 < F_0$, then $\\alpha > 1$ → **position can be scaled up**\n- The sign of $(1 - \\alpha)$ is directly determined by the direction of futures price movement.\n\nThis shows how mark-to-market effects induce **forced deleveraging** or **capital-free leveraging**, depending on the change in futures price, even if the underlying spread logic remains intact.\n\n\n### **Adjusted Return on Capital**\n\nAfter resizing the position to $\\alpha$ contracts, the final payoff at maturity becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text{Payoff}_{\\text{final}} = \\alpha \\cdot (F_0 + m)\n$$\n\nThe original capital deployed was:\n\n$$\nC = S_0 + m\n$$\n\nTherefore, the **adjusted return** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\nr_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot (F_0 + m)}{S_0 + m} - 1\n}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\n$$\n\nWe get:\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\nThis expression quantifies how **mark-to-market price movement** impacts the final return — even though the initial strategy logic (buy low, sell high) is unchanged.\n\n- If $F_1 > F_0$ → position is **deleveraged** → return is **diluted**\n- If $F_1 < F_0$ → position is **leveraged up** → return is **amplified**\n\nThis is a concrete expression of how **capital constraints** under daily margining introduce **convexity** into realized returns.\n\n\n## Return Dynamics Under Uniform Price Shock\n\nWe explore how uniform shocks to spot and futures prices affect the realized return on capital when margin requirements force dynamic position sizing.\n\nLet the initial capital be:\n\n$$\nC = S_0 + m \\quad \\text{with} \\quad m = M \\cdot S_0\n$$\n\nUnder a return shock \\( r \\), we assume:\n\n$$\nS_1 = S_0 (1 + r), \\quad F_1 = F_0 (1 + r)\n$$\n\nThen, the **adjusted return on capital** is:\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\nThe baseline return when \\( r = 0 \\) is:\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\n\n\n\n```{python}\n# Import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\nS0 = 100\nF0 = 105\nM = 0.1\nm = M * S0\n\n# Shock range\nr_vals = np.linspace(-0.3, 0.3, 200)  # -30% to +30%\n\n# Post-shock values\nS1 = S0 * (1 + r_vals)\nF1 = F0 * (1 + r_vals)\n\n# Adjusted return computation\nalpha = 1 - (F1 - F0) / (S1 + m)\nr_adjusted = (alpha * (F0 + m) / (S0 + m)) - 1\n\n# Baseline return\nr_baseline = (F0 + m) / (S0 + m) - 1\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.plot(r_vals, r_adjusted, label=r'$r_{\\mathrm{adjusted}}$', linewidth=2)\nplt.axhline(y=r_baseline, color='gray', linestyle='--', label=r'$r_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$')\nplt.axvline(x=0, color='black', linestyle=':')\nplt.xlabel('Return Shock $r$')\nplt.ylabel('Adjusted Return on Capital')\nplt.title('Impact of Uniform Price Shock on Return')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n```\n\n## **Managing Margin-Induced Convexity: Hedging with Spot**\n\nOn paper, the classic calendar spread strategy appears risk-free — the profit is “locked in” via the forward curve. However, in practice, **daily margining introduces path dependency**. If the general price level rises, the **short futures leg loses value**, triggering margin calls and forcing **liquidation** of part of the long position.\n\nThis causes the strategy to behave like it's **short in the price level $r$**: upward moves reduce return. The realized P&L becomes **concave** even when the theoretical spread remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk Management via Spot Allocation**\n\nTo manage this convexity, one simple hedge is to **hold a small spot position** alongside the calendar spread.\n\nLet:\n\n- $C = S_0 + m$: total capital  \n- $\\beta \\in [0, 1]$: fraction of capital allocated to spot  \n- $(1 - \\beta) \\cdot C$: capital deployed in the calendar spread  \n- $\\beta \\cdot C$: capital held in spot\n\n---\n\n### **Returns on Each Leg**\n\n- The calendar spread grows at rate $r_{\\text{adjusted}}$  \n- The spot grows at rate $r$\n\nThen the total final value is:\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{final}} = (1 - \\beta)C(1 + r_{\\text{adjusted}}) + \\beta C(1 + r)\n$$\n\nDivide by initial capital $C$ to get the total portfolio return:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\nr_{\\text{hedged}} = (1 - \\beta)(1 + r_{\\text{adjusted}}) + \\beta(1 + r) - 1\n}\n$$\n\nThis shows that the **hedged return** is a convex combination of the risky strategy and the linear spot move. It **smooths drawdowns** when the market moves against the short leg, reducing the impact of margin-induced deleveraging.\n\n\n\n## **Visualizing the Impact of Spot Hedging on Return Convexity**\n\nThe plot below compares two versions of the adjusted return:\n\n- **Unhedged return** ($\\beta = 0$): exposed to margin-induced deleveraging\n- **Hedged return** ($\\beta = 50\\%$): partially protected by holding spot\n\nThis shows how allocating part of capital to spot can **reduce concavity** in realized returns by mitigating forced position adjustments during price rises.\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Parameters\nS0 = 100\nF0 = 110\nM = 10\nm = S0 / M\nC = S0 + m\n\n# Shock range\nr = np.linspace(-0.2, 0.2, 200)\nS1 = S0 * (1 + r)\nF1 = F0 * (1 + r)\n\n# Unhedged return (beta = 0)\nr_adjusted = ((1 - (F1 - F0) / (S1 + m)) * (F0 + m)) / (S0 + m) - 1\n\n# Precompute hedged returns for various beta values\nbeta_values = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\nhedged_returns = [\n    (1 - beta) * (1 + r_adjusted) + beta * (1 + r) - 1 for beta in beta_values\n]\n\n# Create plotly traces\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add unhedged trace\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=r*100, y=r_adjusted*100,\n                         mode='lines', name='Unhedged Return (β = 0%)'))\n\n# Add hedged traces (only show β=50% by default)\nfor i, beta in enumerate(beta_values):\n    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n        x=r*100, y=hedged_returns[i]*100,\n        mode='lines',\n        name=f'Hedged Return (β = {int(beta*100)}%)',\n        visible=(i == 2)  # Only show β=50% initially\n    ))\n\n# Dropdown menu logic\ndropdown_buttons = [\n    {\n        \"label\": f\"β = {int(beta*100)}%\",\n        \"method\": \"update\",\n        \"args\": [\n            {\"visible\": [True] + [j == i for j in range(len(beta_values))]},\n            {\"title\": f\"Hedged vs. Unhedged Adjusted Return (β = {int(beta*100)}%)\"}\n        ]\n    }\n    for i, beta in enumerate(beta_values)\n]\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    updatemenus=[\n        {\n            \"buttons\": dropdown_buttons,\n            \"direction\": \"down\",\n            \"showactive\": True,\n            \"x\": 0.5,\n            \"xanchor\": \"center\",\n            \"y\": -0.25,  # BELOW the chart\n            \"yanchor\": \"top\"\n        }\n    ],\n    title=\"Hedged vs. Unhedged Adjusted Return (β = 50%)\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Return Shock (%)\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Portfolio Return (%)\",\n    legend_title=\"Strategy\",\n    height=500\n)\n\nfig.show()     \n```\n## **Visualizing the Forward Curve**\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data for the forward curve\nmaturities = [0, 4, 6, 9]\nprices = [54000, 65000, 75000, 85000]\n\n# Create plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.plot(maturities, prices, marker='o', linewidth=2)\nplt.title(\"Forward Curve\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Maturity (Months)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Price\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nIn forward curve trading, a classic carry strategy involves going long on the spot market while simultaneously shorting a future contract, thereby capturing the implied rate of return as the forward converges to the spot at maturity.
