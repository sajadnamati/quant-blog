This implied return reflects the embedded interest rate in the term structure of the forward curve.\n\nHowever, mark-to-market dynamics introduce a key source of path dependency. When general price levels rise, the short futures leg becomes loss-making, potentially triggering margin calls. Traders must then inject capital or unwind part of the position, leading to a realized return that diverges from the originally implied yield.\n\nConversely, if price levels fall, margin balances become cashflow-positive, enabling position scaling and potentially increasing the strategy's effective return. This asymmetric cashflow exposure makes the anticipated portfolio return sensitive to shifts in the absolute level of the forward curve — i.e., it becomes long-biased in curve level.\n\nTo mitigate this exposure and reduce volatility in realized returns, a modified strategy involves holding an additional long position further along the curve. This acts as a natural hedge against upward shifts in the forward curve, smoothing P&L fluctuations and aligning realized performance more closely with the initial implied rate. The result is a more robust, convex strategy that stabilizes capital efficiency while preserving the core carry logic.\n\n---\n\n## **The Mechanics of the Calendar Spread**\n\nA **calendar spread** — also known as a time spread — involves taking offsetting positions in the same underlying asset across two different maturities. In commodities markets, this typically means going:\n\n- **Long the front (near-term) contract**\n- **Short the deferred (longer-term) contract**\n\nor vice versa, depending on the shape of the forward curve and expectations about how it will evolve. In a classic **carry strategy**, the trader seeks to capture the **implied yield** embedded in a contango curve, where future prices are above near-term prices. The basic position structure is:\n\n- **Long the front-month contract (or spot)**\n- **Short a later-dated future**\n\nThis setup profits as the forward converges toward the spot price over time.\n\n### **Implied Carry Return**\n\nThe theoretical return from this strategy derives from the forward curve slope. Let:\n\n- $F_0$: price of the deferred future  \n- $S_0$: spot or near-term future price  \n- $T$: time to maturity (in years)  \n\nThen the annualized implied return is:\n\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{annual}} = \\left( \\frac{F_0}{S_0} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n$$\n\nThis compounded return reflects what the trader would earn if the carry strategy were repeated continuously throughout the year, assuming no path dependency or capital withdrawal effects. This return also assumes the position is held to maturity and that no capital is forcibly withdrawn due to interim losses (e.g., margin calls).\n\n### **Execution Mechanics**\n\nIn practice, calendar spreads are executed using exchange-traded futures. Each leg is margined separately, and marked-to-market (MTM) **daily**. Then the **compounded annualized return on capital deployed** is:\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{capital}} = \\left( \\frac{F + m}{S_0 + m} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n$$\n\nThis return reflects how margin directly affects capital efficiency. As $m$ increases, the denominator grows, and the return on capital shrinks — even if price differentials remain constant.\n\n\n- **Losses** on one leg require margin top-ups  \n- **Gains** on the other leg increase available collateral  \n\nThis introduces **path dependency**: if prices move sharply in one direction, the losing leg may require cash injections **before** the position converges profitably. This dynamic can cause a divergence between **theoretical and realized** returns, especially in volatile or one-sided markets.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nBecause both legs of a futures spread are marked-to-market (MTM) daily, interim price movements impact capital allocation — even if the spread itself is profitable by expiration. Suppose the strategy is normalized to **1 contract per leg**, with:\n\n- $S_0$: initial spot or near-future price  \n- $F_0$: deferred future price  \n- $m = \\frac{S_0}{M}$: margin required per contract (assumed a constant fraction of spot is required by the brokers)  \n- Initial capital: $S_0 + m$\n\n---\n\n#### **Scenario 1: General Price Levels Rise**\n\nWhen prices rise across the curve — i.e., $S_1 > S_0$ and $F_1 > F_0$ — the **short futures leg** incurs a loss, triggering a **margin call**. Assuming the market uses a daily mark-to-market (MTM) system (as is standard), this loss must be covered by **injecting additional cash**.\n\nWe assume:\n\n- Initial number of contracts: 1 (normalized)  \n- Margin per contract: $m = \\frac{S_0}{M}$  \n- Initial capital: $S_0 + m$  \n- New spot price: $S_1$  \n- New future price: $F_1$\n\n---\n\n##### Step 1: Compute the Margin Shortfall\n\nThe trader is short one contract, and the futures price has increased:\n\n$$\n\\text{Short leg loss} = F_1 - F_0\n$$\n\nTo maintain the position, this amount must be deposited as additional margin:\n\n$$\n\\text{Margin shortfall} = F_1 - F_0\n$$\n\n---\n\n##### Step 2: Sell Fraction $\\alpha$ of the Long Side\n\nTo avoid external capital injection, the trader sells a fraction $\\alpha$ of the long position at price $S_1$. The proceeds are used to meet the margin shortfall:\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\cdot S_1 = F_1 - F_0\n$$\n\nSolving for $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1}\n$$\n\nThis is the **minimum fraction of the long leg** that must be liquidated to maintain the short.\n\n---\n\n##### Step 3: Adjusted Return\n\nOriginally, the strategy expected a final payoff of:\n\n$$\n\\text{Gain}_{\\text{original}} = 1 \\cdot (F_0 + m)\n$$\n\nBut now, with only $(1 - \\alpha)$ contracts remaining, the payoff becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text{Gain}_{\\text{adjusted}} = (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot (F_0 + m)\n$$\n\nSo the effective return is diluted due to the **forced deleveraging** under MTM pressure. Let the initial capital deployed be:\n\n$$\n\\text{Capital}_{\\text{initial}} = S_0 + m\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n- **Original return (no path dependency):**\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{original}} = \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\n- **Diluted return (after selling $\\alpha$ of the long leg):**\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{diluted}} = \\frac{(1 - \\alpha)(F_0 + m)}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\nThis shows how even a profitable spread can underperform due to forced deleveraging from mark-to-market losses on the short leg.\n\n#### **Scenario 2: General Price Levels Fall**\n\nWhen general price levels fall — i.e., $S_1 < S_0$ and $F_1 < F_0$ — the **short leg gains value**, and margin collateral is released. This **freed capital** can be used to scale up the strategy. Assume:\n\n- Original position: 1 contract per leg  \n- Margin per contract: $m = \\frac{S_0}{M}$  \n- Capital per added contract:\n  - Buy long leg: $\\alpha \\cdot S_1$\n  - Margin for both legs: $ \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot m =  \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{S_0}{M}$\n- Total capital required per added pair:  \n  $$\\alpha S_1 + \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{S_0}{M}$$\n\n---\n\n##### Step 1: Freed Capital\n\nThe gain on the short leg is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Margin surplus} = F_0 - F_1\n$$\n\nThis surplus is assumed fully reusable.\n\n---\n\n##### Step 2: Solve for $\\alpha$\n\nWe use the freed margin to fund new contracts:\n\n$$\nF_0 - F_1 = \\alpha \\cdot S_1 + \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{S_0}{M}\n$$\n\nSolve for $\\alpha$:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{F_0 - F_1}{S_1 +  \\cdot \\frac{S_0}{M}}\n$$\n\nThis is the number of **additional contracts** that can be opened with the cash released from MTM gains on the short leg. \n\n---\n\n##### Step 3: Adjusted Gain\n\nThe final number of contracts is:\n\n$$\n1 + \\alpha\n$$\n\nTotal payoff becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text{Gain}_{\\text{adjusted}} = (1 + \\alpha)(F_0 + m)\n$$\n\n---\n\n##### Step 4: Return Comparison\n\nInitial capital (same as before):\n\n$$\n\\text{Capital}_{\\text{initial}} = S_0 + m\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n- **Original return (1 contract):**\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{original}} = \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\n- **Boosted return (after scaling):**\n\n$$\nr_{\\text{boosted}} = \\frac{(1 + \\alpha)(F_0 + m)}{S_0 + m} - 1\n$$\n\nThis shows how early MTM profits free up margin that allows **leveraged scaling**, amplifying the effective return. The strategy becomes **convex**: it performs better when prices fall early, even though the long leg is losing money.\n\n### **Summary: Margin Dynamics and Path-Dependent Returns**\n\n| Scenario                  | Price Movement     | Margin Effect        | Trader Action              | Return Expression                                                                 | $\\alpha$ Expression                                                                 | $\\alpha$ Sign |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1.
