This implied return reflects the embedded interest rate in the term structure of the forward curve.\n\nHowever, mark-to-market dynamics introduce a key source of path dependency. When general price levels rise, the short futures leg becomes loss-making, potentially triggering margin calls. Traders must then inject capital or unwind part of the position, leading to a realized return that diverges from the originally implied yield.\n\nConversely, if price levels fall, margin balances become cashflow-positive, enabling position scaling and potentially increasing the strategy's effective return. This asymmetric cashflow exposure makes the anticipated portfolio return sensitive to shifts in the absolute level of the forward curve â€” i.e., it becomes long-biased in curve level.\n\nTo mitigate this exposure and reduce volatility in realized returns, a modified strategy involves holding an additional long position further along the curve. This acts as a natural hedge against upward shifts in the forward curve, smoothing P&L fluctuations and aligning realized performance more closely with the initial implied rate. The result is a more robust, convex strategy that stabilizes capital efficiency while preserving the core carry logic.\n\n---\n\n## **Visualizing the Forward Curve**\n\n::: {#28679bf2 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data for the forward curve\nmaturities = [0, 4, 6, 9]\nprices = [54000, 65000, 75000, 85000]\n\n# Create plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.plot(maturities, prices, marker='o', linewidth=2)\nplt.title(\"Forward Curve\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Maturity (Months)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Price\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](sample-post_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=758 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
