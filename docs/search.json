    "section": "The Mechanics of the Calendar Spread",
    "text": "The Mechanics of the Calendar Spread\nA calendar spread — also known as a time spread — involves taking offsetting positions in the same underlying asset across two different maturities. In commodities markets, this typically means going:\n\nLong the front (near-term) contract\nShort the deferred (longer-term) contract\n\nor vice versa, depending on the shape of the forward curve and expectations about how it will evolve. In a classic carry strategy, the trader seeks to capture the implied yield embedded in a contango curve, where future prices are above near-term prices. The basic position structure is:\n\nLong the front-month contract (or spot)\nShort a later-dated future\n\nThis setup profits as the forward converges toward the spot price over time.\n\nImplied Carry Return\nThe theoretical return from this strategy derives from the forward curve slope. Let:\n\n\\(F_0\\): price of the deferred future\n\n\\(S_0\\): spot or near-term future price\n\n\\(T\\): time to maturity (in years)\n\nThen the annualized implied return is:\n\\[\nr_{\\text{annual}} = \\left( \\frac{F_0}{S_0} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n\\]\nThis compounded return reflects what the trader would earn if the carry strategy were repeated continuously throughout the year, assuming no path dependency or capital withdrawal effects. This return also assumes the position is held to maturity and that no capital is forcibly withdrawn due to interim losses (e.g., margin calls).\n\n\nExecution Mechanics\nIn practice, calendar spreads are executed using exchange-traded futures. Each leg is margined separately, and marked-to-market (MTM) daily. Then the compounded annualized return on capital deployed is:\n\\[\nr_{\\text{capital}} = \\left( \\frac{F + m}{S_0 + m} \\right)^{\\frac{365}{T}} - 1\n\\]\nThis return reflects how margin directly affects capital efficiency. As \\(m\\) increases, the denominator grows, and the return on capital shrinks — even if price differentials remain constant.\n\nLosses on one leg require margin top-ups\n\nGains on the other leg increase available collateral\n\nThis introduces path dependency: if prices move sharply in one direction, the losing leg may require cash injections before the position converges profitably. This dynamic can cause a divergence between theoretical and realized returns, especially in volatile or one-sided markets.\n\nBecause both legs of a futures spread are marked-to-market (MTM) daily, interim price movements impact capital allocation — even if the spread itself is profitable by expiration. Suppose the strategy is normalized to 1 contract per leg, with:\n\n\\(S_0\\): initial spot or near-future price\n\n\\(F_0\\): deferred future price\n\n\\(m = \\frac{S_0}{M}\\): margin required per contract (assumed a constant fraction of spot is required by the brokers)\n\nInitial capital: \\(S_0 + m\\)\n\n\n\n\nCapital-Constrained Position Adjustment\nWe now derive how the number of contracts adjusts after any price movement, based purely on capital accounting.\nLet:\n\n\\(S_0\\): initial spot price\n\n\\(F_0\\): initial futures price\n\n\\(S_1\\): current spot price\n\n\\(F_1\\): current futures price\n\n\\(m = \\dfrac{S_0}{M}\\): margin required per contract\n\n\\(C = S_0 + m\\): total capital initially allocated to the strategy\n\n\n\nUpdated Capital After Mark-to-Market\nThe mark-to-market (MTM) value change on the futures leg is:\n\\[\n\\Delta F = F_1 - F_0\n\\]\nThis is positive if the futures price increased (a loss on the short), and negative if the futures price decreased (a gain on the short).\nThe updated available capital becomes:\n\\[\nC_{\\text{after}} = S_1 + m - \\Delta F = S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)\n\\]\n\n\n\nNew Number of Contracts\nEach unit of the strategy now costs:\n\\[\nS_1 + m\n\\]\nLet \\(\\alpha\\) be the number of contracts that the updated capital can support:\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{C_{\\text{after}}}{S_1 + m} = \\frac{S_1 + m - (F_1 - F_0)}{S_1 + m}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\n}\n\\]\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe expression \\(1 - \\alpha\\) gives the fractional change in position size.\nIf \\(F_1 &gt; F_0\\), then \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\) → some contracts must be liquidated\nIf \\(F_1 &lt; F_0\\), then \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\) → position can be scaled up\nThe sign of \\((1 - \\alpha)\\) is directly determined by the direction of futures price movement.\n\nThis shows how mark-to-market effects induce forced deleveraging or capital-free leveraging, depending on the change in futures price, even if the underlying spread logic remains intact.\n\n\n\nAdjusted Return on Capital\nAfter resizing the position to \\(\\alpha\\) contracts, the final payoff at maturity becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Payoff}_{\\text{final}} = \\alpha \\cdot (F_0 + m)\n\\]\nThe original capital deployed was:\n\\[\nC = S_0 + m\n\\]\nTherefore, the adjusted return is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nr_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot (F_0 + m)}{S_0 + m} - 1\n}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\\[\n\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m}\n\\]\nWe get:\n\\[\nr_{\\text{adjusted}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{F_1 - F_0}{S_1 + m} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{F_0 + m}{S_0 + m} - 1\n\\]\nThis expression quantifies how mark-to-market price movement impacts the final return — even though the initial strategy logic (buy low, sell high) is unchanged.\n\nIf \\(F_1 &gt; F_0\\) → position is deleveraged → return is diluted\nIf \\(F_1 &lt; F_0\\) → position is leveraged up → return is amplified\n\nThis is a concrete expression of how capital constraints under daily margining introduce convexity into realized returns."

    "text": "Managing Margin-Induced Convexity: Hedging with Spot\nOn paper, the classic calendar spread strategy appears risk-free — the profit is “locked in” via the forward curve. However, in practice, daily margining introduces path dependency. If the general price level rises, the short futures leg loses value, triggering margin calls and forcing liquidation of part of the long position.\nThis causes the strategy to behave like it’s short in the price level \\(r\\): upward moves reduce return. The realized P&L becomes concave even when the theoretical spread remains unchanged.\n\n\nRisk Management via Spot Allocation\nTo manage this convexity, one simple hedge is to hold a small spot position alongside the calendar spread.\nLet:\n\n\\(C = S_0 + m\\): total capital\n\n\\(\\beta \\in [0, 1]\\): fraction of capital allocated to spot\n\n\\((1 - \\beta) \\cdot C\\): capital deployed in the calendar spread\n\n\\(\\beta \\cdot C\\): capital held in spot\n\n\n\n\nReturns on Each Leg\n\nThe calendar spread grows at rate \\(r_{\\text{adjusted}}\\)\n\nThe spot grows at rate \\(r\\)\n\nThen the total final value is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{final}} = (1 - \\beta)C(1 + r_{\\text{adjusted}}) + \\beta C(1 + r)\n\\]\nDivide by initial capital \\(C\\) to get the total portfolio return:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\nr_{\\text{hedged}} = (1 - \\beta)(1 + r_{\\text{adjusted}}) + \\beta(1 + r) - 1\n}\n\\]\nThis shows that the hedged return is a convex combination of the risky strategy and the linear spot move. It smooths drawdowns when the market moves against the short leg, reducing the impact of margin-induced deleveraging."
